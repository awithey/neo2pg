# neo2pg
Copy Neo4j nodes to a PostgreSQL database

# DO NOT USE THIS! (yet)

This is very much a work in progress.

When it's usable, I''l change the README.md :-)

This requires a [Neo4j link](http://neo4j.com/download/) database AND a [PostgreSQL link](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) database.

Dependancies:
py2neo
	pip install py2neo
